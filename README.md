# Novel-And-Effective-Queue-Management-Using-Computer-Vision-

This project is about effective queue management using PyTorch and YOLO.

Steps to run:

1.Open VS Code

2.Open folder there in vs code.

3.There are two options 

  3.1 Either you run the video stored in folder(Here by name queue.mp4)
  or 
  
  3.2 You enable camera and record your video and get real time experience.
  
  For 3.2 you need to modify line 5
  
  and make it to cap = cv.VideoCapture(0) 
  
  here by passing argument as 0 it will enable your camera and will detect the face from your camera.
  
  
  Let you save this project as "AIModel/Project/VideoCapture.py"
  
  Further Installments to be made on computer to run before:
  
  1.Download python in computer.
 
 2.Open cmd and after that type command cd AIModel/Project
 
 3.Then run project by typing command python VideoCapture.py
 
 4.If it shows any error-
    These error may be "opencv2 not detected" then install opencv by command according to version of python installed in your laptop by command "opencv-contrib-python".
    It will then download the several libraries like pytorch,opencv and much more.
 
 5-It will run error free now or if it asks for specific modules not found then do follow stack overflow as for different computers it differ.
